# Solana Token Minting Application

Welcome to the Solana Web3-Solana-Token-Functions-Master! This application allows users to create a new mint, create a token account, and mint tokens on the Solana blockchain ecosystem.

## Features

- **Create a New Mint:** Users can create new mints for their tokens directly from the application. Mints are essential for generating new tokens on the Solana blockchain.

- **Create a Token Account:** Token accounts are required to hold tokens on the Solana blockchain. With this feature, users can create token accounts seamlessly.

- **Mint Tokens:** Once a mint and token account are created, users can mint new tokens directly from the application. Minting tokens increases the token supply and makes them available for transactions.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GodricGryffindorK/Web3-Solana-Token-Functions-Master
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```

3. Starting command:

   ```

## Usage

To use this application, make sure you have followed the installation steps. Replace *filename* with the actual filename of the script you want to run (e.g. ```npx esrun Lesson1.gernerate-keypair.ts```). The application will guide you through creating a new mint, creating a token account, and minting tokens.
